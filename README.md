# Graph
## Goal
- Implement generic, reusable implementations of the graph data-structure for Kotlin multi-platform
- Teach myself how to properly set up a project

## Sub-goals

### Cover all basic implementations
There are three basic implementations of the graph data structure:
- Adjacency list (which I think is a misnomer because my implementation does not use a list, so I called it adjacency map)
- Adjacency matrix
- Incidence matrix

### Keep everything highly generic
Both the vertexes and the edge weight should be generic

### Keep it user friendly
I.e don't let give the user the need to define an edge weight if it's not needed for that specific use case

### Make it run fast
